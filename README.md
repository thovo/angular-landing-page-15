# Landing page with Angular 15

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.10. This is used to demonstrate how can we "defer" loading our components based on some conditions.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
